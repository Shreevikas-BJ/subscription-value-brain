***📊 Subscription Value Brain***

End-to-End Churn, CLV & Uplift Modeling System

A production-style data science project that shows how subscription businesses (Netflix/Spotify/SaaS-like) can reduce churn and optimize marketing spend by targeting the right customers with the right offers.

**🚀 What This Project Does**

  The system answers four key business questions:

  Who is likely to churn? (Churn prediction)

  How valuable is each customer? (CLV)

  Will marketing actually help? (Uplift modeling)

  Who should be targeted first? (Unified scoring)

  The final output is an interactive Streamlit dashboard that simulates real marketing decisions under budget constraints.

**🧠 Modeling Approach**

*1️⃣ Churn Prediction*

  Models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost

  Metrics: ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, Precision@K

  Output: p_churn (probability of churn)

  *2️⃣ Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)*

  Features: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

  Model: Random Forest Regressor

  Log-transformed monetary values to handle skew

  Output: clv (expected future value)

  *3️⃣ Uplift Modeling*

  Two-model approach:

  Treatment model → P1

  Control model → P0

  Uplift = P1 − P0

  Model: Random Forest Classifier

  Customers segmented into:

  Persuadable, Sure Thing, Lost Cause, Do-Not-Disturb

  *4️⃣ Targeting Score*
    target_score = p_churn × clv × uplift_positive

  Ranks customers by expected retained revenue.
